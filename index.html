      <p><em>And they called off the circus, burned the disco down</em></p>

      <p>When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns</p>

      <p>I'm still on that tightrope</p>

      <p>I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me</p>

      <p>I'm still a believer, but I don't know why</p>

      <p>I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try</p>

      <p>I'm still on that trapeze</p>

      <p><strong>I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me</strong></p>
